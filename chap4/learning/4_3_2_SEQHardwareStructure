SEQ: SEQuential Structure.

Processing is performed by 'hardware units'
associated with different stages.

In SEQ, all of the processing by the hardware units occurs within
a single clock cycle.



6 stages

Fetch : Using the program counter(PC) register as an address,
	  	the instruction memory reads the bytes of an instruction.
		The PC incrementer computes valP, the incremented PC.

Decode:	The register file has 2 read ports, A and B, via which
		register values valA and valB are read simultaneously.

Execute:		The execute stage uses the arithmetic/logic unit(ALU)
			for different purposes according to the instruction type.
			For integer operations, it performs the specified operation.
			For other instructions, it serves as an adder to compute an
			incremented or decremented stack pointer, to compute an effective
			address, or simply to pass one of its inputs to its outputs by
			adding 0.
				The condition code register(CC) holds the 3 condition code bits.
			New values for the condition codes are computed by the ALU. When
			executing a conditional move instruction, the decision as to whether
			or not to update the destination register is computed based on the
			condition codes and mov condition. Similarly, when executing a jump
			instruction. the branch signal Cnd is computed based on the condition
			codes and the jump type.

Memory	:	The data memory reads or writes a word of memory when executing a memory
			instruction. The instuction and data memories access the same memory
			locations, but for different purpose.
	
Write back	: 	The register file has 2 write ports. Port E is used to write values
				computed by the ALU, while port M is used to write values read from
				the data memory.

PC update	:	The new value of the program counter is selected to be either
				valP, the address of the next instruction, valC, the destination
				address specified by a call or jump instruction, or valM, the return
				address read from memory.

In this stage, we can complete the computation of the status code Stat by detecting
the case of an invalid address for the data memory. Write HCL code for the signal m_stat.

word m_stat = [
    dmem_error : SADR;  # The furthest instruction error(memory stage in this case) will be taken.
    1 : M_stat;
];

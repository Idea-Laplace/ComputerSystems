word Min3 = [
	A <= B && A <= C : A;
	B <= C && B <= C : B;
	1			 	 : C;
];

The HCL code given for computing the minimum of 3 words
contains 4 comparison expressions of the form x <= y.
Rewrite the code to compute the same result, but using
only 3 comparisons.


Ans)

word Min3 = [
	A <= B && A <= C : A;
	B <= C			 : B;
	1			 	 : C;
];

If !(A <= B && A <= C), only X <= A <= Y or X <= Y <= A form is possible.
Hence comparison between B and C is sufficient to determine the minimum.

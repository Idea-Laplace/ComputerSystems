Write Y86-64 code to implement a recursive product function rproduct,
based on the following C code:

long rproduct(long *start, long count) {
	if (count <= 0) 
		return 1;
	return *start * rproduct(start + 1, count - 1);
}

Use the smae argument passing and register saving convention as x86-64
code does. You might find it helplful to complile the C code on an
x86-64 machine and then translate instruction to Y86-64.

Suppose we could take the system of Figure 4.32 and divide it into an arbitary
number of popeline stages k, each having a delay of 300/k, and with each pipeline
register having a delay of 20 ps.

A. What would be the latency and the throughput of the system, as functions of k?

Ans)
Throughput:

clock: 300/k ps + 20 ps
Throughput = 1 / clock
           = 1 / (300/k + 20) ps
           = [k / (300 + 20k)] ps-1


Latency:

k * ( 300 / k + 20) ps = (300 + 20k) ps


B. What would be the ultimate limit on the throughput?

k -> infinity, throughput -> 1/20ps = 500 GIPS
(Just a theoretical value, you cannot make stage comsuming time 0 for real.)
(Also, latency goes to infinity as k goes to infinity, since Latency = 300 + 20k.)

In other words, you can't make a clock cycle shorter than 20 ps.

When you split one more, then latency would be added by 20 ps.

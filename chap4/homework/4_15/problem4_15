What would be the effect of the instruction pushq %rsp according
to the steps listed in Figure 4.20? Does this conform to the desired
behavior for Y86-64, as determined in Problem 4.7?

Figure 4.20

Stage		pushq rA
--------------------------------
Fetch		icode:ifun <- M1[PC]
			rA:rB <- M1[PC + 1]
			valP <- PC + 2

Decode		valA <- R[rA]
			valB <- R[%rsp]

Execute		valE <- valB <- (-8)

Memory		M8[valE] <- R[rA]

Write back	R[%rsp] <- valE

PC update	PC <- valP



As shown in the Decode and Memory block, the saved data will be the original %rsp value,
and then %rsp will be updated by 8 like other normal cases. This process conforms to the
desired behavior for Y86-64.

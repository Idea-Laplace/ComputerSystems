The conditional move instructions, abbreviated cmovXX, have instruction
code IRRMOVQ. As Figure 4.28 shows, we can implement these instructions
by making use of the Cnd signal, generated in the execute stage.

Modify the HCL code for dstE to implement these instructions.


word dstE = [
		(icode == IRRMOVQ) && Cnd : rB;
		icode in { IIRMOVQ, IOPQ } : rB;
		icode in { IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, ICALL, IRET } : RRSP;
		1 : RNONE;
];

'&& Cnd' added to the end of 1st line of dstE block.

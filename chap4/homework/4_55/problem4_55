The file pipe-nt.hcl contains a copy of the HCL code for PIPE, plus a declaration
of the constant J_YES(C_YES) with value 0, the function code for an uncondtional jump
instruction. Modify the branch prediction logic so that it predicts condtional
jumps as being not taken while containing to predict unconditional jumps and call
as being taken. You will need to devise a way to get valC, the jump target address,
to pipeline register M to recover from mispredicted branches. see the lab material
for directions on how to generate a simulator for your solution and how to test it.

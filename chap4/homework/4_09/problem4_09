Write an HCL expression for a signal XOR, equal to the exclusive-or
of inputs a and b. what is the relatio between the signals xor and eq
defines above?

Ans) xor = (a && !b) || (!a && b)

The signal eq means that a and b have same inputs(00 or 11),
while the signal xor impiles that a and b have different inputs(10 or 01)

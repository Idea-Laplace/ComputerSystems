The block labeled 'dstE' in the decode stage generates the register ID for the E port
of the register file, based on fields from the fetched instruction in pipeline register D.
The resulting signal is named d_dstE in the HCL description of PIPE.
Write HCL code for this signal, based on the HCL description of the SEQ signal dstE.
(See the decode stage for SEQ in Section 4.3.4)
Do not concern yourself with the logic to implement condtional move yet.

word d_dstE = [
        D_icode in { IRRMOVQ, IIRMOVQ, IOPQ } : D_rB;
        D_icode in { IPUSHQ, IPOPQ, ICALL, IRET } : RRSP;
        1 : RNONE;
];

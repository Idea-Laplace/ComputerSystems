Assume the 2 register writes in the write-back stage for popq
occur in the order listed in Figure 4.20. What would be the effect of
executing popq %rsp? Does this conform to the desired behavior for Y86-64,
as determined in Problem 4.8?


Figure 4.20

Stage			popq rA
----------------------------------
Fetch			icode:ifun <- M1[PC]
				rA:rB <- M1[PC + 1]
				valP <- PC + 2

Decode			valA <- R[%rsp]
				valB <- R[%rsp]

Execute			valE <- valB + 8   # Address after pop.

Memory			valM <- M8[valA]   # Normal popped value.

Write back		R[%rsp] <- valE	   # Normal %rsp increment
				R[%rA] <- valM	   # Overwrite happens when rA = %rsp.

PC update		PC <- valP


The writing valM on %rsp occurs later, hence %rsp will be overwritten
by its corresponding address value. %rsp <- (%rsp)

Write HCL code describing a circuit that for word inputs A, B and C
selects the median of the three values. That is, the output equals
the word lying between the minimum and maximum of the 3 inputs.


word Median3 = [
	B <= A && A <= C : A;
	C <= A && A <= B : A;
	A <= B && B <= C : B;
	C <= B && B <= A : B;
	1				 : C;
];

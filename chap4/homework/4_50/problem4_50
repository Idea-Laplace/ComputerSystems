    In section 3.6.8, we saw that a common way to implement switch statement is to
create a set of code blocks and then index those blocks using a jump table.
Consider the C code shown in Figure 4.69 for a function switchv, along with associated
test code.
    Implement switchv in Y86-64 using a jump table. Although the Y86-64 instruction set
does not include an indirect jump instruction, you can get the same effect by pushing a
computed address onto the stack and then executing the ret instruction. Implement test
code similar to what is shoun in C to demonstrate that your implementation of switchv
will handle both the cases explicitly as well as those that trigger the default case.

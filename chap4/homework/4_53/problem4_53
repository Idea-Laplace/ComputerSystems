    Suppose we wanted to create a lower-cost pipelined processor based on the
structure we devised for PIPE- without any bypassing. The design would handle
all data dependencies by stalling until the instruction generating a needed
value has passed through the write-back stage.
    The file pipe-stall.hcl[pipe-nobypass.hcl] contains a modified version of
the HCL code for PIPE in which the bypassing logic has been disabled. That is,
the signals e_valA and e_valB are simply declared as follows:

## Do not MODIFY THE FOLLOWING CODE.
## No forwarding. valA is either valP or value from register file

word d_valA = [
    D_icode in { ICALL, IJXX } : D_valP # Use incremented PC.
    1: d_rvalA                          # Use value read from register file.
];

## No forwarding, valB is value from register file
word d_valB = d_rvalB

Modify the pipeline control logic at the end of this file so that it correctly
handles all possible control and data hazards. As part of your design effort,
you should analyze the different combinations of control cases, as we did in the
design of the pipline control logic for PIPE, You will find that many different
combinations can occur, since many more conditions require the pipeline to stall.
Make sure your control logic handes each combination correctly. See tha lab material
for directions on how to generate a simulator for your solution and how to test it.

    The file pipe-btfnt.hcl contains a copy of the HCL code for PIPE, plus a declaration
of the constant J_YES with value 0, the function code for an unconditional jump instruction.
Modify the branch prediction logic so that it predicts conditional jumps as being taken when
valC < valP and as being not taken when valC >= valP. Continue to predict unconditional jumps
and call as being taken. You will need to devise a way to get both valC and vlaP to pipeline
register M to recover from mispredicted branches. See the lab material for directions on how
to generate a simulator for your solution and how to test it.

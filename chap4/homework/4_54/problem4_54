    The file pipe-full.hcl contains a copy of the PIPE HCL description, along with
a declaration of the constant value IIADDQ. Modify this file to implement the iaddq
instruction, as described in practice 4.3 and problem 4.51. See the lab material for
direction on how to generate a simulator for your solution and how to test it.

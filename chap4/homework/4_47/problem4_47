Your assignment will be to write a Y86-64 program to perform bubblesort.
For reference, the following C function implement bubblesort using array referencing:

/* Bubble sort: Array version */
void bubble_a(long *data, long count) {
    long i, last;
    for (last = count - 1; last > 0; last--) {
        for (i = 0; i < last; i++)
            if (data[i+1] < data[i]) {
                /* Swap adjacent elements */
                long t = data[i+1];
                data[i+1] = data[i];
                data[i] = t;
            }
    }
}

A.  Write and test a C version that references the array elements with pointers,
    rather than using array indexing.

B.  Write and test a Y86-64 program consisting of the function and test code.
    You may find it useful to pattern your implementation after x86-64 code
    generated by compiling your C code. Although pointer comparison are normally
    done using unsigned arithmetic, you can signed arithmetic for this this exercise.

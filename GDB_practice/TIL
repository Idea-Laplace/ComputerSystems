For users to make fully use of functions of gdb, you should add the '-g' option
when compiling

ex) gcc -g hello.c -o hello

Though one can still use gdb on a file that compiled without '-g',
You would not exploit many advantages of gdb.

When you are to add your own setting on gdb, just add lines in ~/.gdbinit.

#GPT version

To fully benefit from gdb’s debugging features, you should compile your program with the -g option.

Example:
gcc -g hello.c -o hello

While it is still possible to use gdb with a program compiled without -g, most of the useful debugging information—such as source code lines and variable names—will not be available.

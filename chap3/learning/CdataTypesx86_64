C declaration		Assembly-code suffix	Size(byte)
------------------------------------------------------
   char				b(byte)                 1
   short			w(word)					2
   int				l(double)				4
   long				q(quad)					8
   char *			q(quad)					8
   float			s(single)				4
   double			l(double)				8

Microprocessors in the x86 family historically implemented all
floating-point operations with a spectial 80-bit(10 bytes) floating
point format. This format can be specified in C programs using the
declaration long double. We recommend against using this format, however.
It is not portable to other classes of machines, and it is typically not
implemented with the same high-performance hardware as is the case for
single- and double-precision arithmetic.


The assembly code uses the suffix 'l' to denote a 4-byte integer
as well as an 8-byte double-precision floating point number.
This causes no ambiguity, however, since floating-point code involves
an entirely different set of instructions and registers.

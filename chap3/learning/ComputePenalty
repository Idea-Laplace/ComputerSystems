Assume the probability of misinterpretation is p, the time to execute the code
without mispretation is T_ok, and the misinterprediction penalty is T_mp.
Then the average time to execute the code as a function of p is:

T_max = T_ok + T_mp
T_avg = (1-p)T_ok + p(T_ok + T_mp) = T_ok + pT_mp.

When p is higher, so is T_avg as predicted.

Line 8 of the assembly code shown above contains the instruction rep; ret.
These are rendered in the diassembled code as repz and retq. One can infer
that repz is a synonym for rep, just as retq is synonym for ret. Looking at
the Intel and AMD documentation for the rep instruction, we find that it is
normally used to implement a repeating string operation. It seems completely
inappropriate here. The answer to this puzzle can be seen in AMD's guidelines
to compiler writers. They recommend using the combination of rep followed by
ret to avoid making the ret instruction the destination of a conditional jump
instruction(The first instruction to designated label).
Without the rep instruction, the jg instruction(line 7) would proceed to the
ret instruction when the branch is not taken(branch not taken: condition false)
According to AMD, their processors cannot properly predict the destination of a
ret instruction when it is reached from a jump instruction. The rep instrunction
serve as a form of no-operation here, and so inserting it as the jumpm destination
does not change behavior of the code, except to make it faster on AMD processors. 
We can safely ignore any rep or repz instuction we see in the rest of the code
presented in CSAPP 3E book.

In the following excerpts from a disassembled binary, some of the
information has been replaced by X's. Answer the following questions
about these instructions.

*PC relative: Program Counter relative - The difference between the address of the
				target instruction and the address of the instruction following
				just after the jump(physically) instruction. Difference is given as
				two's complement type

A. What is the target o fthe je instruction below?
(You do not need to anything about the callq instruction here.)

	4003fa:		74 02		je		XXXXXX
	4003fc:		ff d0		callq	*%rax

The instruction address following the jump: 4003fc, [ff, callq]
Bytes of difference: 0x02

Target instruction address: 0x4003fc + 0x02 = 0x4003fe


B. What is the targe of the je instruction  below?

	40042f:		74 f4		je		XXXXXX
	400431:		5d			pop		%rbp


The instruction address following the jump: 400431, [5d, pop]
Bytes of difference: 0xf4 = -0xc
Target instruction address: 0x400431 - 0xc = 0x400425

C. What is the address of the ja and pop instruction?

	XXXXXX: 	77 02		ja 		400547
	XXXXXX:		5d			pop		%rbp


Bytes of difference: 02
Address of the instruction pop: 0x400547 - 0x02 = 0x400545
Address of the ja instruction : 0x400545 - 0x02 = 0x400543

D. In the code that follows, the jump target is encoded in PC-relative form as a
   4-byte two's-complement number. The bytes are listed from least significant to
   most, reflecting the little-endian byte ordering of x86-64. What is the address
   of the jump target?

	4005e8:	e9 73 ff ff ff	jmpq	XXXXXX
	4005ed: 90				nop

Bytes of difference: 0xffff73 (little endian)
Address of the instrction just after the jump instruction: 0x4005ed
Target instruction address: 0xd005ed + 0xffffff73 = 0x4005ed - 0x8d = 0x400560


Anser
A. 0x4003fe
B. 0x400425
C. 0x400543, 0x400545
D. 0x400560

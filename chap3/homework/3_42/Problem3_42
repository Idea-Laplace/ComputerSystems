The following code shows the declaration of a structure of type ACE
and the prototype fro a function test:

struct ACE {
	short v;
	struct ACE *p;
};

short test(struct ACE *ptr);


When the code for fun is compiled, GCC generates the following assembly
code:

test:
	movl	$1, %eax
	jmp		.L2
.L3
	imulq	(%rdi), %rax
	movq	2(%rdi), %rdi
.L2
	testq	%rdi, %rdi
	jne		.L3
	rep; ret

A. Use your reverse engineering skills to write C code for test.
B. Describe the data structure that this structure implements and the
   operation performed by test.

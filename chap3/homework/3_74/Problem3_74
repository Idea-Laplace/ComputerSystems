Write a function in assembly code that matches the behavior of the function
find_range in Figure3.51. Your code should contain only one floating-point
comparison instruction, and then it should use conditional moves to generate
the correct result.
You might want to make use of the instruction cmovp(move even parity). Test
your code on all 2^32 possible argument values, Web aside: ASM: EASM on p.214
describe how to incorporate functions written in assembly code into C programs.

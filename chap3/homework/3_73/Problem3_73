Write a function in assembly code that matches the behavior of the function
find_range in Figure 3.51. Your code should contain only one floating-point

the correct resul. Test your code on all 2^32 possible argument values. Web Aside
ASM:EASM on page 214 describes how to incorporate functions written in assembly
code into C program.

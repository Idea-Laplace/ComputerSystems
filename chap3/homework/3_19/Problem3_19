Running on a new processor model, our code required around 45 cycles when
the branching pattern was random, and around 25cycles when the pattern was
highly predictable.

A. What is the approximate miss penalty?

Sol) Assume that the 25-cycle given is the time consumed when a given
	 prediction succeeded. Let p be the probability of misinterpretation,
	 we can put p = 0.5 form the statement 'when the branching pattern was random'.

	 45 cycle  = 25 cycle + 0.5 * T_penalty
	 T_penalty = 40 cycle

B. How many cycles would the function require when the branch is misinterpreted?

Sol) T_miss = T_ok = T_penalty
			= 25 cycle + 40 cycle
			= 65 cycle

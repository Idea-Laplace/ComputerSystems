For C code having the general form:

long loop_while2(long a, long b) {
	long result = ___;
	while (___) {
		result = ___;
		b = ___;
	}
	return result;
}

GCC, run with command=line option -O1, produces the following code:

loop_while2:
	testq	%rsi, %rsi
	jle		.L8
	movq	%rsi, %rax
.L7
	imulq	%rdi, %rax
	subq	%rdi, %rsi
	testq	%rsi, %rsi
	jg		.L7
	rep; ret
.L8
	movq	%rsi, %rax
	ret

We can see that the compiler used a guarded-do translation, using the
jle instruction on line 3 to skip over the loop code when the initial
test fails. Fill in the missing parts of the C code. Note that the control
sturcture in the assembly code does not exactly match what would be obtained
by a direct translation of the C code according to our translation rules.
In particular, it has two different ret instructions. However, you can fill
out the missing portions of the C code in a way that it will have equivalent
behavior to the assembly code.

Running our stack-checking code 10,000 times on a system Linux version 2.6.16,
we obtained addresses ranging form a minimum of 0xffffb754 to a maximum of
0xffffd754.

A. What si the approximate range of addresses?

 0xffffd754
-0xffffb754
-----------
 0x00002000, 8192 in decimal

 Address can be differ by about 8,200 byte

 B. If we attempted a buffer overrun with a 128-byte nop sled, about how
 many attempts would it take to test all starting addresses?

 8192 byte = 2^13 byte
 128 byte  = 2^7 byte

 13 - 7 = 6, 2^6 = 64.

 Even in the worst case, 64 times of attak would successfully corrupt the target.

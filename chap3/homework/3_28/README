The problem 3.28 seems to be erroneous.

I think the code has erreta and updated wrongly.
So I revised overall code of 3.28 in reference to its solution.

Initial code:
test_two:
	movq	$1, %edx
	movl 	$65, %eax
.L10
	movq	%rdi, %rcx
	andl	$1, %ecx
	addq	%rax, %rax
	orq		%rcx, %rax
	shrq	%rdi
	addq	$1, %rdx
	jne		.L10
	rep; ret

=================================

Revised code:

test_two:
	movq	$16, %edx
	movl 	$0, %eax
.L10
	movq	%rdi, %rcx
	andl	$1, %ecx
	addq	%rax, %rax
	orq		%rcx, %rax
	shrq	%rdi
	subq	$1, %rdx
	jne		.L10
	rep; ret

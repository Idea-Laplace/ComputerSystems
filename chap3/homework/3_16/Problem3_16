When given the C code

void cond(short a, short *p) {
	if (a && *p < a)
		*p = a;
}

GCC generates the following assembly code:

cond:
	testq	%rdi, %rdi
	je		.L1
	cmpq	%rsi, (%rdi)
	jle		.L1
	movq	%rdi, (%rsi)
.L1:
	rep; ret

A. Write a goto version in C that performs the same computation and mimics
   the control flow of the assembly cdoe, in the style shown in Figure 3.16(b).
   You might find it helpful to first annotate the assembly code we have done
   in our examples.

B. Explain why the assembly code contains two conditional branches, even though
   the C code has only one if statement.

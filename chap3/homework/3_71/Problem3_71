Write a function good_echo that reads a line from standard
input and writes it to standard output. Your implemenatation
should work for an input line of arbitrary length. You may
use the library function fgets, but you must make sure your
function works correctly evne when the input line requires
more space than you have allocated for your buffer. Your
code should also check for error conditions and returns when
one is encountered. Refer to the definition of the standard
I/O functions for documentation.

For C code having the gereral form:

short loop_whle(short a, short b) {
	short result = ___;
	while (___) {
		result = ___;
		a = ___;
	}

	return result;
}

GCC run with command-line option -Og, produces the following code:

loop_while:
	movl	$0, %eax
	jmp		.L2
.L3:
	leaq	(, %rsi, %rdi), %rdx
	addq	%rdx, %rax
	subq	$1, %rdi
.L2:
	cmpq	%rsi, %rdi
	jg		.L3
	rep; ret

We can see that the compiler used a jump-to-middle translation, using the jmp
instruction on line 3 to jump to the test starting with label .L2. Fill int the
missing parts of the C code.

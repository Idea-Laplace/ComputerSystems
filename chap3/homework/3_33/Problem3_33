A C function procprob has four arguments u, a, v, and b. Each is either
a signed number or a pointer to a signed number, where the numbers have
different sizes, Teh function has the following body:

*u += a;
*v += b;
return sizeof(a) + sizeof(b);

It compiles to the following x86-64 code:

procprob:
	movslq	%edi, %rdi
	addq	%rdi, (%rdx)
	addb	%sil, (%rcx)
	movl	$6, %eax
	ret

Determine a valid ordering and types of the four parameters.
There are two correct answers.

Answer 1

u : long *
a : int
v : signed char *
b : short

Answer 2

u : signed char *
a : short
v : long *
b : int

Consider the following structure declaration:

struct test {
	short *p;
	struct {
		short x;
		short y;
	} s;
	struct test *next;
};

This declaration illustrates that one structure can be embedded within another,
just as arrays can be embedded within structures and arrays can be embedded within
arrays.

The following procedure (with some expressions omitted) operaates on this
structure:

void st_init(struct test *st) {
	st->s.y = ___;
	st->p = ___;
	st->next = ___;
}

A. What are the offsets (in bytes) of the following fields?

p: 0
s.x: 8
s.y: 10
next: 12

B. How many total bytes does the structure requires?

8 + (2 + 2) + 8 = 20 (byte);

C. The compiler generates the following assembly code for st_init:

st_init:
	movl	8(%rdi), %eax
	movl	%eax, 10(%rdi)
	leaq	10(%rdi), %rax
	movq	%rax, (%rdi)
	movq	%rdi, 12(%rdi)
	ret

On the basis of this information, fill in the missing expression in the code for st_init;

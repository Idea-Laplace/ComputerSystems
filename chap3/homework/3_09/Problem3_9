Suppose we want to generate assembly code for the following C function:

long shift_left4_rightn(long x, long n) {
	x <<= 4;
	x >> n;
	return x;
}

The code that follows is a portion of the assembly code that performs the
actual shifts and leaves the final value in register %rax. Two key instructions
have been omitted. Parameters x and n are stored in registers %rdi and %rsi, respectively.

shift_left4_rightn:
movq %rdi, %rax
---------------
movl %esi, %ecx
---------------

Fill in the missing instructions, following the annotation on the right.
The right shift should be performed arithmetically(long type).

shift_left4_rightn:
movq	%rdi, %rax
shlq	$4, %rax
movl	%esi, %ecx
sarq	%cl, %rax

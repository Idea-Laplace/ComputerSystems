Up until the 1980s, every computer manufacturer divised its own
conventions for how floating point numbers were represented and
the details of the operations performed on them. In addition,
they often did not worry too much about the accuracy of the op-
-erations, viewing speed and ease of implementation as being more
critical than numerical precision.

	All of this changed around 1985 with the advent of IEEE Standard 754,
a carefully crafted standard for representing floating numbers and
the operations performed on them. This effort started in 1976 under
Intel's sponsorship with the design of the 8087, a chip that provided
floating point support for the 8086 processor. Intel hired William Kahan,
a professor at the University of Califonia, Berkeley, as a consultant to
help design a floating point standard for its future processors. They
allowed Kahan to join forces with a committee generating an industry-wide
standard under the auspices of the IEEE. The committee ultimately adopted
a standard close to the one Kahan had devised for Intel.
	Nowadays, virtually all computers support what has become known as
IEEE floating point.

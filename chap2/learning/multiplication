x *(u, w) y = (x * y) mod(2^w)
x *(t, w) y = U2T(x *(u, w) y)

T2B(x *(t, w) y) = U2B(x *(u, w) y)

Let x and y are in the range of two's complement representation,
that is, from -2^(w-1) to 2^(w-1) - 1.

x' := x + x_(w-1)2^w
y' := y + y_(w-1)2^w

both x and x' are have same bit representation, so do y and y'.

T2B(x *(t, w) y) = T2B(U2T(x' *(u, w) y'))
                 = U2B(x' *(u, w) y')

The library function calloc has the follwoing declaration:

void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);

According to the library documentation, "The calloc function allocates
memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each. The memory is
set to zero. If nmemb or size is 0, then calloc returns NULL."

Write an implementation of calloc that performs the allocation by a call
to malloc and sets the memeory to 0 via memset. Your code should not have
any vulnerablities due to arithmetic overflow, and it should work correctly
regardless of the number of bits used to represent data of type size_t.

As a reference, functions malloc and memset have the following declarations:

void *malloc(size_t size);
void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);

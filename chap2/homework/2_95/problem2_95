Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function
with the following prototype:

// Compute 0.5*f. If f is NaN, then return f.
float_bits float_twice(float_bits f);

For floating-point number f, this function computes 0.5 * f. If f is NaN, your
function should return f.

Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of argument f and comparing
the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating point operations.

The Digital Equiment VAX computer was a very popular machine
from the late 1970s until the late 1980s. Rather than instruction
for Boolean operations 'AND' and 'OR', it had instruction:

bis(bit set)
bic(bit clear)

Both instructions take a data word x and a mask word m.
They generate a result z consisting of the bits of x modified
according to the bits of m.
With bis, the modification involves setting z to 1 at each bit
position where m is 1, With bic, the modification involves setting
z to 0 at each bit position where m 1.
	to see how thes operations relate to the C bit-level operations,
assume we have functions bis and bic implementating tht bit set of and
bit clear operations, and that we want to use these to impelment functions
computing bitwise operations | and ^, without using any other C operations.

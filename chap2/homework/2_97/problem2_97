Following the bit-level floating-point rules, implement the function with
the following prototype:


/* Compute (float) i. */

int float_i2f(int f);

For argument i, this function computes the bit-level representation of (float) i.

Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of argument i and comparing
the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operation.

/*
   We can represent a bit pattern of length w = 4 with a single hex digit.
   For an unsigned interpretation of these digits, use Equation 2.12 to fill
   in the following table giving the values and the bit representations (in hex)
   of the unsigned additive inverse of the digits shown.

   ------- -------
      x    (u,4)-x
   ------- -------
     0x1    0x15
	 0x4    0x12
	 0x7    0x09
	 0xa    0x06
	 0xe    0x02

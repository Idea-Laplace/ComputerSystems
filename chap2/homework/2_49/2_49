A. For a floating format with an n-bit fraction, give a formula
for the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented exactly.
Assume the exponent field size k is large enough that the range of
representable exponents does not provide a limitation for this problem.

sol) The LSB of n-bit fraction represent the value of 2^(-n).
     When the exponent value comes to be 2^n, the number ranges from
	 2^n, 2^n + 1, ... ,2^n + 2^(n-1) + ... + 1
	 and finally to 2^(n+1). The next integer should be 2^(n+1) + 2,
	 not 2^(n+1) + 1.

	 2^(n+1) + 1.

B. What is the numeric value of this integer for single-precision format,
   n=23?

Ans) 2^24 + 1.

Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with
the following prototype:

/* Compute -f, if f is NaN, then returns f. */
float_bits float_negate(float_bits f);

For floating-point number f, this function computes -f, if f is NaN, your function
should simply return f.

Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of argument f and comparing
the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operations.

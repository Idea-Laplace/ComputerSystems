Suppose we given the task of generating code to multiply integer variable x
by various different constant factor K. To be efficient, we want to use only
the operations +, -, and <<. For the following values of K, write C expressions
to perform the multiplication using at most 3 operations per expression.

A. K = 17

Ans) (x << 4) + x;

B. K = -7

Ans) x - (x << 3);

C. K = 60

Ans) (x << 6) - (x << 2);

D. K = -112

Ans) (x << 4) - (x << 7);

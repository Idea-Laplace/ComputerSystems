Following the bit-level floating-point rules, implement the function with
the following prototype:


/* Compute (int) f.
 * If conversion casues overflow or f is NaN, return 0x80000000(INT_MIN)
 */

int float_f2i(float_bits f);

For floating-point number f, this function computes (int) f. Your function
should round toward zero. If f cannot be represented as an integer, then the
function should return 0x80000000.

Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of arguments f and
comparing the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-
point operations.

You have been assigned the task of writing a C function to compare a
floating-point representation of 2^x. You decide that the best way to
do this is to directly construct  the IEEE single-precision represent-
ation of the result. When x is too small, it will return +infinity.
Fill in the blank portions of the code that follows to compute the
correct result. Assume the function u2f returns a floating-point
value having identical bit representation as its unsigned argument.

Write code for a function with the following prototype:

Do rotating left shift. Assume 0 <= n < w
Examples when x = 0x12345678 and w = 32.
n = 4 --> 0x23456781, n = 20 --> 0x67812345

unsigned rotate_left(unsigned x, int n);

Your function should follow the bit-level integer coding rules.
Be careful of the case n = 0;

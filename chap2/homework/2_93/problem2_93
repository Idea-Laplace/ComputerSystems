Following the bit-level floating-point coding rules, implement the function with
the following prototype:

float_bit float_absval(float_bits f);

for floating-point number f, this function computes  |f|. If f is NaN,
your function should simply return f.

Test your function by evaluating it for all 2^32 values of argument f and comparing
the result to what would be obtained using your machine's floating-point operations.

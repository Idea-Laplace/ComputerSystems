In chapter 3, we'll look at listings generated by diassembler,
a program that converts an executable program file back to a more
readable ASCII form. These files contain many hexadecimal numbers,
typically representing values in two's complement form. Being able
to recognize these numbers and understand their significance is
an important skill.

	For the lines labeled A-I in the following listing. convert
the hexadecimal values (in 32-bit two's complement form) shown
to the right of the instruction names (sub move, and add) into
their decimal equivalents:

A. 0x2e0 : 512 + 224 = 736
B. -0x58 : -(80 + 8) = -88
C. 0x28  : 32 + 8 = 40
D. -0x30 : -48
E. 0x78  : 120
F. 0x88  : 136
G. 0x1f8 : 504
H. 0xc0  : 192
I. -0x48 : -72

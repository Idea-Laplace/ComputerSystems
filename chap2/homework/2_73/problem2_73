Write code for a function with the following prototype:

// Addition that saturates to TMin or TMax
int saturating_add(int x, int y);

Instead of overflowing the way normal two's complement addition does, saturating
addition returns TMax when there would be positive overflow, and TMin when there
would be negative overflow. Staturating arithmetic is commonly used in programs
that perform digital signal processing.
 Your function should follow the bit-level coding rules.
